  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2025-05-24 (YYYY-MM-DD)</p>

  <p><strong>Reddit Block Chrome</strong> ("the Extension") is a Chrome extension developed by Paprika-Ditch ("we", "our", or "us"). We are committed to respecting your privacy. This policy outlines our data practices and transparency commitments.</p>

  <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information, device data, or user activity. All functionality is handled entirely on your device. No data ever leaves your computer through our extension.</p>

  <h2>2. No Profit Motive</h2>
  <p>This extension is provided completely free of charge. It contains no ads, subscriptions, affiliate links, or monetization of any kind. It exists solely to enhance your browsing experience.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Data Collection</h2>
  <p>While we do not collect any information, we cannot control what <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google</a> or the Chrome Web Store platform may collect independently (such as usage or crash data through the browser itself).</p>

  <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
  <p>The Extension requests only the permissions required for its core functionality. These permissions are used exclusively to provide features and are never used to collect or transmit personal data.</p>
  <p>We are actively working to minimize permissions and will continue refining them to maintain functionality while upholding user privacy.</p>

  <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If we update this Privacy Policy, changes will be posted here with a new effective date. Continued use of the Extension constitutes acceptance of any updates.</p>
